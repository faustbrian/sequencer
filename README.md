------

A powerful Laravel package that orchestrates sequential execution of migrations and operations. Ensures database changes and business logic run in chronological order during deployments, preventing conflicts and maintaining data integrity.

## Requirements

> **Requires [PHP 8.4+](https://php.net/releases/)** and Laravel 11+

## Installation

```bash
composer require cline/sequencer
```

## Quick Start

Create an operation, implement the `handle()` method, and execute sequentially with `php artisan sequencer:process`. See [Getting Started](cookbook/getting-started.md) for detailed examples.
