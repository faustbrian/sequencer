/**
 * Artisan command to process pending migrations and operations sequentially.
 *
 * This command discovers all pending migrations and operations, sorts them by
 * timestamp, and executes them in chronological order. Supports isolation mode
 * for atomic locking in multi-server environments, dry-run preview, resumption
 * from specific timestamps, and re-execution of completed operations.
 *
 * ```bash
 * # Process all pending migrations and operations
 * php artisan sequencer:process
 *
 * # Preview execution order without running tasks
 * php artisan sequencer:process --dry-run
 *
 * # Run with atomic lock to prevent concurrent execution
 * php artisan sequencer:process --isolate
 *
 * # Resume from specific timestamp
 * php artisan sequencer:process --from=2024_01_01_120000
 *
 * # Re-execute completed operations
 * php artisan sequencer:process --repeat
 * ```
