/**
 * Orchestrates parallel batch execution of operations with strict failure handling.
 *
 * Executes all operations in parallel using Laravel's batch system for maximum
 * throughput. Unlike AllowedToFailBatchOrchestrator, this orchestrator does not
 * use allowFailures() - any operation failure will cause the entire batch to fail.
 * Migrations are executed sequentially first to maintain schema integrity.
 *
 * Use this orchestrator when you need parallel execution but require strict
 * all-or-nothing semantics where any failure should halt the entire batch.
 * Best for tightly coupled operations where partial completion is unacceptable.
 *
 * ```php
 * // All operations must succeed for batch to complete
 * final readonly class ProcessCriticalData implements Operation
 * {
 *     public function handle(): void
 *     {
 *         // Any failure here will fail the entire batch
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see AllowedToFailBatchOrchestrator For fault-tolerant batch execution
 * @see TransactionalBatchOrchestrator For batch execution with automatic rollback
