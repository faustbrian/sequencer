/**
 * Transactional batch orchestrator with all-or-nothing semantics and automatic rollback.
 *
 * Executes operations in parallel as a batch but provides distributed transaction semantics
 * through automatic rollback on failure. When any operation fails, all successfully completed
 * operations implementing the Rollbackable interface are rolled back in reverse execution order.
 * This provides ACID-like guarantees across distributed operations that don't share a database
 * transaction.
 *
 * Use this orchestrator when you need parallel execution with strong consistency guarantees.
 * Best for critical operations where partial completion is unacceptable and compensating
 * actions can restore the system to its original state. Operations must implement Rollbackable
 * to participate in automatic rollback.
 *
 * ```php
 * // Operations can implement rollback logic
 * final readonly class TransferFunds implements Operation, Rollbackable
 * {
 *     public function handle(): void
 *     {
 *         // Transfer funds between accounts
 *     }
 *
 *     public function rollback(): void
 *     {
 *         // Reverse the transfer if batch fails
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see BatchOrchestrator For parallel execution without rollback
 * @see AllowedToFailBatchOrchestrator For parallel execution with fault tolerance
