/**
 * Thrown when attempting scheduled dispatch on operations without Scheduled interface.
 *
 * This exception occurs when trying to execute an operation via the scheduled orchestrator
 * or ProcessScheduledCommand, but the operation class does not implement the Scheduled
 * contract. Operations must implement Scheduled to define their execution time via the
 * executeAt() method, which the orchestrator uses to determine when to execute the operation.
 *
 * This is a development-time error indicating missing interface implementation rather
 * than a runtime condition. Operations intended for scheduled execution must explicitly
 * declare they implement Scheduled and provide an execution time.
 *
 * ```php
 * // Incorrect - missing Scheduled interface:
 * final class MaintenanceOperation implements Operation
 * {
 *     public function handle(): void
 *     {
 *         // Maintenance logic
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * // Attempting scheduled dispatch throws exception:
 * try {
 *     $orchestrator = new ScheduledOrchestrator();
 *     $orchestrator->execute(new MaintenanceOperation());
 * } catch (OperationMustImplementScheduledException $e) {
 *     // Exception: Operation must implement Scheduled interface
 * }
 *
 * // Correct - implements Scheduled:
 * final class MaintenanceOperation implements Operation, Scheduled
 * {
 *     public function executeAt(): DateTimeInterface
 *     {
 *         return now()->setTime(2, 0); // Execute at 2am
 *     }
 *
 *     public function handle(): void
 *     {
 *         // Maintenance logic
 *     }
 * }
